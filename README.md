# 2048 Game - C++ with Qt5

This repository contains the source code for a simple implementation of the popular 2048 game in C++ using the Qt5 framework. The game is played on a 4x4 grid, where the goal is to combine tiles with the same number to reach the tile with the value of 2048.

## Getting Started

To run the game, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/drstrange102/2048-Game.git
   
2. Open the project in Qt Creator or your preferred C++ IDE that supports Qt development.

3. Build and compile the project.

4. Run the executable to start the game.


## How to Play

- Use the "W," "A," "S," and "D" keys to move the tiles up, left, down, and right, respectively.

- Tiles with the same value will merge when they collide.

- Your objective is to create a tile with the value of 2048.

- The game ends when there are no more valid moves possible or when you reach the 2048 tile.
    
    
## Features

- User-friendly graphical interface built with the Qt5 framework.

- Basic logic of the 2048 game, including tile movement and merging.

- Display of the current game state and score.

- Game-over condition detection.
  
- Smooth animations and transitions.
